Hi, I am Kevin, and one of the Tech Writers at Crate. This is my Sandbox. In this
project, I practice using reStructuredText.

About reStructuredText
======================

This is an example reStructuredText document that I wrote, to get used to
working with reStructuredText. reStructuredText is a markdown language that
is used to create the CrateDB documentation at Crate. Most parts of the
documentation come as stylish and well structured HTML, and it is all done using
reStructuredText, which is a WYSISWG plaintext markup syntax and parser system.
Using reStructuredText, you can quickly create websites and standalone
documentation.

In order to get used to it, I would say it is best to minimize the
chatter and get into the writing.

But first, I want to summarize the what the following sites will contain:

- A list of useful resource on reStructuredText and the Sphinx CheatSheet
- Text syntax
