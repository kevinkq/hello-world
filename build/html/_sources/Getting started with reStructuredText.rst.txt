Getting started with reStructuredText
=====================================

Introduction
============

So tables in reStructuredText are literally **painted**. Below, I have created
an example for you. For this table to make sense, I have added a few basic
terminal commands for myself to remember, and to get used to working with tables
in reStructuredText.

+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| Syntax                 | Terminal Command                                   |
+========================+====================================================+
| **$ sudo su**          |Every command that needs root's permission,         |
|                        |needs this sudo command. You can use sudo before    |
|                        |each command that requires root permissions.        |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| **/home$ ls**          |With list command, the terminal will show you all   |
|                        |the files and folders of the directory that you're  |
|                        |working in.                                         |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| **cd**                 | Change directory (cd) is the main command that you |
|                        | will always use in terminal. Just type the name of |
|                        | the folder you want to go in from your current     |
|                        | directory. If you want to go up just do it by      |
|                        | giving double dots (..) as the parameter...        |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| body row 2             | ...                                                |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| body row 2             | ...                                                |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| body row 2             | ...                                                |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| body row 2             | ...                                                |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| body row 2             | ...                                                |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| body row 2             | ...                                                |
+------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| body row 2             | ...                                                |
