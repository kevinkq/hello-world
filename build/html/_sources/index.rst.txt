* Welcome
* Getting started with reStructuredText
* reStructuredText next steps

 The content in this guide serves mainly as my personal reference and playground
 for the (hopefully) daily sparring sessions with reStructuredText. I am writing
 this content to learn the ropes of using reStructuredText on a daily basis.

 As a member of the technical writing team, which comprises Naomi Slater and
 myself at the time of writing (May 2019), effectively working with
 reStructuredText is necessary. So let's do this and familiarize for high
 quality future contributions to the CrateDB documentation.

 These HTML websites have been generated using reStructuredText. Here I plan on
 going through the following steps to get the grips with reStructuredText:

 #. Learn basic RST-formatting by doing it, including:

    * bulleted lists
    * such as this one unordered lists

    #. numbered lists
    #. such as this one

 #. Take on more complex tasks like hyperlinking etc.

 #. Look a the integration of images a) in the repo and b) in a text.

 #. Learn what else there is to reStructuredText.

Also look up my source of information here: `reStructuredText basics <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_
